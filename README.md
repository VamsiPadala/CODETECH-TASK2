Project Overview: Clustering Analysis on the Iris Dataset
Objective
The objective of this project is to explore unsupervised learning techniques by performing clustering analysis on the Iris dataset. The goal is to identify natural groupings or patterns within the data using various clustering algorithms and evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms using appropriate metrics.

Steps
Loading and Preprocessing the Data

Load the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the machine learning community.

Standardize the data to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.

Clustering Algorithms

Implement three different clustering algorithms:

K-means Clustering: A partition-based method that divides the data into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

Hierarchical Clustering: An agglomerative method that builds a tree of clusters by recursively merging or splitting existing clusters.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A density-based method that identifies clusters based on the density of points in the data space, allowing for the detection of arbitrarily shaped clusters and noise.

Evaluation of Clustering Results

Use the Silhouette Score to measure how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher score indicates better-defined clusters.

Use the Daviesâ€“Bouldin Index to assess the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the one that is most similar to it. A lower index indicates better clustering performance.

Visualization

Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots to visually inspect the clusters formed by each algorithm.

Use a side-by-side comparison of the clusters generated by K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to gain insights into the effectiveness of each method.
